**kameloso** idles in your channels and listens to commands and events, like bots generally do.

## Current functionality includes:

* chat monitoring in bedazzling colours like it's the 90s
* automatic mode sets (e.g. auto `+o` on join)
* logs
* reporting titles of pasted URLs
* **sed**-replacement of messages (`s/this/that/` substitution)
* saving notes to offline users that get played back when they come online
* channel polls
* works on **Twitch** with some common Twitch bot features
* [more random stuff and gimmicks](https://github.com/zorael/kameloso/wiki/Current-plugins)

All of the above are plugins and can be runtime-disabled or compiled out. It is modular and easily extensible. A skeletal Hello World plugin is [20 lines of code](source/kameloso/plugins/hello.d).

Testing is primarily done on [**freenode**](https://freenode.net) and on [**Twitch**](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide) servers, so support and coverage is best there.

**Please report bugs. Unreported bugs can only be fixed by accident.**

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

There are three [D](https://dlang.org) compilers available; see [here](https://wiki.dlang.org/Compilers) for an overview. You need one based on D version **2.084** or later (January 2019).

**kameloso** can be built using the reference compiler [**dmd**](https://dlang.org/download.html), which compiles very fast; and the LLVM-based [**ldc**](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases), which is slower at compiling but produces faster code. The stable release of the GCC-based [**gdc**](https://gdcproject.org/downloads) is currently based on version **2.076** and is thus too old to be used.

The package manager [**dub**](https://code.dlang.org) is used to facilitate compilation and dependency management. On Windows it comes bundled in the compiler archive, while on Linux it may need to be installed separately. Refer to your repositories.

## Downloading

Pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Linux can be found under [releases](https://github.com/zorael/kameloso/releases). Alternatively, download and compile it yourself.

### Fetching a copy of the source

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/zorael/kameloso.git
```

## Compiling

```sh
$ dub build
```

This will compile the bot in the default *debug* mode, which adds some extra code and debugging symbols. You can automatically omit these and add some optimisations by building it in *release* mode with `dub build -b release`. Mind that build times will increase accordingly. Refer to the output of `dub build --help` for more build types.

### Build configurations

There are several configurations in which the bot may be built.

* `application`, base configuration
* `twitch`, additionally includes Twitch chat support and the Twitch streamer plugin
* `dev`, all-inclusive development build equalling everything available, including things like more detailed error messages

All configurations come in a `-lowmem` variant (e.g. `application-lowmem`, `twitch-lowmem`, ...) that lowers compilation memory at the cost of increasing compilation time, but so far they only work with **ldc**. (bug [#20699](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20699))

List configurations with `dub build --print-configs`. You can specify which to compile with the `-c` switch. Not supplying one will make it build the default `application` configuration.

```sh
$ dub build -c twitch
```

> If you want to customise your own build to only compile the plugins you want to use, see the larger `versions` lists in `dub.sdl`. Simply add or delete a character from the line corresponding to the plugin(s) you want to omit (thus invalidating the version identifier). Mind that disabling any of the "*service*" plugins may break the bot in subtle ways.

# How to use

## Configuration

The bot ideally wants the account name of one or more administrators of the bot, and/or one or more home channels to operate in. Without either it's just a read-only log bot, which is also fine. To define these you can either specify them on the command line, with flags listed by calling the program with `--help`, or generate a configuration file and input them there.

```sh
$ ./kameloso --save
```

A new `kameloso.conf` will be created in a directory dependent on your platform.

* **Linux** and other Posix: `~/.config/kameloso` (alternatively where `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` points)
* **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\kameloso`
* **macOS**: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/kameloso`

Open the file in a normal text editor. If you have your system file associations set up to open `*.conf` files in such, you can pass `--gedit` to attempt to open it in a graphical editor, or `--edit` to open it in your default terminal one (as defined in the `$EDITOR` environment variable).

### Command-line arguments

Settings provided at the command line override any such already defined in your configuration file. If you specify some and also add `--save`, it will apply the changes to your file in-place.

```sh
$ ./kameloso \
    --server irc.freenode.net \
    --nickname "kameloso" \
    --admins "you,friend" \
    --homeChannels "#mychannel,#elsewhere" \
    --guestChannels "#d,##networking" \
    --save

[12:34:56] Configuration written to /home/user/.config/kameloso/kameloso.conf
```

Settings not specified at invocations of `--save` keep their values. Mind however that the file is parsed and *rewritten*, so any comments and/or invalid entries in it will be silently removed.

### Display settings

If you have a bright terminal background, text may be difficult to read, depending on your terminal emulator. If so, pass the `--bright` argument, and/or modify the configuration file; `brightTerminal` under `[Core]`. The bot uses the full range of [8-colour ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit), so if one or more colours are too dark or bright even with the right `brightTerminal` setting, please refer to your terminal appearance settings. Colouring might not work well with greyish theming.

An alternative is to disable colours entirely with `--monochrome`.

### Other files

More server-specific resource files will be created the first time you connect to a server. These include `users.json`, in which you whitelist which accounts get to access the bot's features on a per-channel basis. Where these are stored also depends on platform; in the case of **macOS** and **Windows** they will be put in server-split subdirectories of the same directory as the configuration file, listed above. On **Linux** and other Posix, under `~/.local/share/kameloso` (or wherever `$XDG_DATA_HOME` points to).

### Online help and commands

Use the `!help` command for a summary of available bot commands, and `!help [plugin] [command]` for a brief description of a specific one. The shorthand `!help !command` also works.

The command **prefix** (here `!`) is configurable; refer to your generated configuration file. Common alternatives are `.` and `~`, making it `.note` and `~quote` respectively.

```ini
[Core]
prefix                  "!"
```

It can technically be any string and not just one character. It may include spaces if enclosed within quotes, like `"please "` (making it `please note`, `please quote`, ...). Additionally, prefixing commands with the bot's nickname also works, as in `kameloso: seen MrOffline`. This is to be able to disambiguate between several bots in the same channel. Additionally, some administrative commands only work when called this way.

### **Except nothing happens**

Before allowing *anyone* to trigger any restricted functionality, the bot will query the server for what services account the accessing user is logged onto. For full administrative privileges you will need to be logged in with an account listed in the `admins` field in the configuration file, while other users may be defined in your `users.json` file. If a user is not logged onto services it is considered as not being uniquely identifiable.

> In the case of hostmasks mode, the above still applies but "accounts" are inferred from hostmasks. See the **Admin** plugin `!hostmask` command (and the `hostmasks.json` file) for how to map hostmasks to would-be accounts. Hostmasks are a weaker solution to user identification but not all servers may offer services.

## Twitch

To connect to Twitch servers you must first build a configuration that includes support for it, which is currently either `twitch` or `dev`.

You must also supply an [OAuth token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) **pass** (not password). These authorisation tokens are unique to your user paired with an application. As such, you need a new one for each and every program you want to access Twitch with.

Run the bot with `--set twitchbot.keygen` to start the captive process of generating one. It will open a browser window, in which you are asked to log onto Twitch *on Twitch's own servers*. Verify this by checking the page address; it should end with `.twitch.tv`, with the little lock symbol showing the connection is secure.

> Note: At no point is the bot privy to your login credentials! The logging-in is wholly done on Twitch's own servers, and no information is sent to any third parties. The code that deals with this is open for audit; [`generateKey` in `twitchbot/api.d`](source/kameloso/plugins/twitchbot/api.d).

After entering your login and password and clicking **Authorize**, you will be redirected to an empty "this site can't be reached" page. Copy the URL address of it and paste it into the terminal, when asked. It will parse the address, extract your authorisation token, and offer to save it to your configuration file.

If you prefer to generate the token manually, here is the URL you need to follow. The only thing the generation process does is open it for you, and help with saving the end key to disk.

```
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=tjyryd2ojnqr8a51ml19kn1yi2n0v1&redirect_uri=http://localhost&scope=bits:read+channel:edit:commercial+channel:read:subscriptions+user:edit+user:edit:broadcast+channel_editor+user_blocks_edit+user_blocks_read+user_follows_edit+channel:moderate+chat:edit+chat:read+whispers:edit+whispers:read
```

### Caveats

Most of the bot's features will work on Twitch. The **Automode** plugin is an exception (as modes are not really applicable on Twitch), and it will auto-disable itself appropriately.

That said, in many ways Twitch chat does not behave as a full IRC server. Most common IRC commands go unrecognised. Joins and parts are not always advertised, and when they are they come in delayed batches and cannot be relied upon. You can also only join channels for which a corresponding Twitch user account exists.

### Example configuration

```ini
[IRCClient]
nickname            botaccount
user                ignored
realName            likewise

[IRCBot]
#account
#password
pass                personaloauthauthorisationtoken
admins              mainaccount
homeChannels        #mainaccount,#botaccount
guestChannels       #streamer1,#streamer2,#streamer3

[IRCServer]
address             irc.chat.twitch.tv
port                6667
```

The Twitch SSL port is **6697** (or **443**).

See [the wiki page on Twitch](https://github.com/zorael/kameloso/wiki/Twitch) for more information.

### Streamer assistant bot

The streamer bot is enabled by default when built, and can be disabled in the configuration file under the `[TwitchBot]` section. If the section doesn't exist, ensure that you have built a configuration with Twitch support, then regenerate the file with `--save`. Even if enabled it disables itself on non-Twitch servers.

```sh
$ ./kameloso --set twitchbot.enabled=false --save
```

Properly enabled and assuming a prefix of `!`, commands to test are:

* `!enable`, `!disable`
* `!start`, `!uptime`, `!stop`
* `!phrase`
* `!timer`
* `!permit`
* `!followage`

...alongside `!operator`, `!whitelist`, `!blacklist`, `!oneliner`, `!poll`, `!counter`, `!stopwatch`, and other non-Twitch-specific commands.

> Note: dot `.` and slash `/` prefixes will not work on Twitch.

**Please make the bot a moderator to prevent its messages from being as aggressively rate-limited.**

## Further help

For more information and help see [the wiki](https://github.com/zorael/kameloso/wiki), or [file an issue](https://github.com/zorael/kameloso/issues/new).

# Known issues

Compiling in a non-`debug` build mode *may* fail (bug [#18026](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18026)). Try `--build-mode=singleFile`, which compiles one file at a time and as such lowers memory requirements, but drastically increases build times.

## Windows

If SSL doesn't work at all, you may simply be missing the required libraries. Download and install **OpenSSL** "Light" from [here](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html), and opt to install to system directories when asked.

Even with SSL seemingly properly set up you may see errors of *"Peer certificates cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates"*. If this happens, download this [`cacert.pem`](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem) file, place it somewhere reasonable, and edit your configuration file to point to it; `caBundleFile` under `[Connection]`.

# Roadmap
