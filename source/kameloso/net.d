    Functionality related to connecting to a server over the Internet.

    Includes [core.thread.fiber.Fiber]s that help with resolving the address of,
    connecting to, and reading full string lines from a server.

    Having them as [core.thread.fiber.Fiber]s means a program can do address resolution,
    connecting and reading while retaining the ability to do other stuff
    concurrently. This means you can conveniently run code inbetween each
    connection attempt, for instance, without breaking the program's flow.

    Example:
    ---
    import std.concurrency : Generator;

    Connection conn;
    bool abort;  // Set to true if something goes wrong

    conn.reset();

    bool useIPv6 = false;
    enum resolveAttempts = 10;

    auto resolver = new Generator!ResolveAttempt(() =>
        resolveFiber(conn, "irc.freenode.net", 6667, useIPv6, resolveAttempts, abort));

    resolver.call();

    resolveloop:
    foreach (const attempt; resolver)
    {
        // attempt is a yielded `ResolveAttempt`
        // switch on `attempt.state`, deal with it accordingly
    }

    // Resolution done

    enum connectionRetries = 10;

    auto connector = new Generator!ConnectionAttempt(() =>
        connectFiber(conn, false, connectionRetries, abort));

    connector.call();

    connectorloop:
    foreach (const attempt; connector)
    {
        // attempt is a yielded `ConnectionAttempt`
        // switch on `attempt.state`, deal with it accordingly
    }

    // Connection established

    enum timeoutSeconds = 600;

    auto listener = new Generator!ListenAttempt(() => listeFiber(conn, abort, timeoutSecond));

    listener.call();

    foreach (const attempt; listener)
    {
        // attempt is a yielded `ListenAttempt`
        doThingsWithLineFromServer(attempt.line);
        // program logic goes here
    }

// listenFiber
/++
    A [std.socket.Socket]-reading [std.concurrency.Generator]. It reads and
    yields full string lines.

    It maintains its own buffer into which it receives from the server, though
    not necessarily full lines. It thus keeps filling the buffer until it
    finds a newline character, yields [ListenAttempt]s back to the caller of
    the Fiber, checks for more lines to yield, and if none yields an attempt
    with a [ListenAttempt.State] denoting that nothing was read and that a new
    attempt should be made later.

    Example:
    ---
    //Connection conn;  // Address previously connected established with

    enum timeoutSeconds = 600;

    auto listener = new Generator!ListenAttempt(() => listenFiber(conn, abort, timeoutSeconds));

    Given an address and a port, resolves these and populates the array of unique
    `std.socket.Address` IPs inside the passed [Connection].

    Example:
    ---
    import std.concurrency : Generator;

    Connection conn;
    conn.reset();

    auto resolver = new Generator!ResolveAttempt(() =>
        resolveFiber(conn, "irc.freenode.net", 6667, false, 10, abort));

    resolver.call();

    resolveloop:
    foreach (const attempt; resolver)
    {
        // attempt is a yielded `ResolveAttempt`

        with (ResolveAttempt.State)
        final switch (attempt.state)
        {
        case preresolve:
            assert(0, "shouldn't happen");

        case success:
            // Address was resolved, the passed `conn` was modified
            break resolveloop;

        case exception:
            // Recoverable
            dealWithException(attempt.error);
            break;

        case failure:
            // Resolution failed without errors
            failGracefully(attempt.error);
            break;

        case error:
            // Unrecoverable
            dealWithError(attempt.error);
            return;
        }
    }

    // Address resolved
    ---

    Params:
        conn = Reference to the current [Connection].
        address = String address to look up.
        port = Remote port build into the [std.socket.Address].
        useIPv6 = Whether to include resolved IPv6 addresses or not.
        abort = Reference "abort" flag, which -- if set -- should make the
            function return and the [core.thread.fiber.Fiber] terminate.
